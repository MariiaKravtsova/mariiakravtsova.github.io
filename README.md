# mariiakravtsova.github.io

This repository is created with Github pages, and it is a live website that could be found at http://mariiakravtsova.github.io

Currently this website uses Jekyll. 

I plan on posting a blog post once a week, the posts will be about my coding and life experinces. 
I will also be developing a layout for this page, and add more pages as I go. I will try and keep an updated to-do list here.
This to-do list only applies to my personal projects and will be completed as time allows.

## To Do:
* Design the website's layout to incorporate the desired fetures
* Use Bootstrap to make the paper - reality
* Use JavaScript and JQuery to make it dynamic
* Add portfolio items
