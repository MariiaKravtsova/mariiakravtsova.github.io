Atom has had its ups and downs, but even through the slow times, I still used it. I tried Sublime, I tried Visual Studio, I tried Coda 2, and I found happiness with [Atom](https://atom.io) during this summer. I have tried different plugins, and I am opened to suggestions, but I guess I just wanted to share what I am using now. So here are my little minions:

- [autoclose-html](https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html)

Who likes to close brackets? Browsers already know to ignore that anyway.

- [beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)

Sometimes I have something in mind that I want to try, so I just want to write it, and Beautify will catch me if I didn’t start a new line, or put extra spaces.

- [color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker)

Gone are the days when I open photoshop just to lookup the colors to use, it’s all right here.

- [git control](https://atom.io/packages/git-control)

I gave a shot to git plus, but I found git control easier to manage file individually. I don’t use branches much, but with this gui they seem less scary.

- [javascript-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/javascript-snippets)

How many times have you typed console.log(); ? With this shortcuts you can finally stay focused and have less typos.

- [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)

Get that cat hair out of my code.

- [todo-show](https://atom.io/packages/todo-show)

It can show me all of my TODO of FIXME that I left in the code. Usually I forget where stuff is, or it  has been five days since I opened this file, and this is a nice way to show me where I left of. If there is a way to set reminders and deadlines on my calendar, that would be fabulous.

I have not found a perfect theme, but my current one is [Nucleus Dark UI](https://atom.io/themes/nucleus-dark-ui).
