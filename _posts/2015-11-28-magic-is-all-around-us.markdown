There is an abundance of programming languages, and there a lot of opinions on which
one is better then the other. However, each was created with a specific purpose in mind, and it has its own features.

Regardless, every language falls on a spectrum of low to high. Low level languages like C
let you have a lot of control over how the computer compiles the program, how stuff runs
into registers, what are the 0s and 1s doing. Assembly gives you even more control. On the
other hand, high level languages don’t make you worry about digital logic or registers, you
just type “string” and you need no worry about ASCII characters.

Before this semester I have only experienced high level language - C#. Writing things in C and
 Assembly for my Computer Organization class has been mind blowing. We use MSP430 micro controller
 to see what is going on, how the overflow flags work, and how much stuff is going on behind the scene.
 Doing small operations requires work, and logic. When I got the light flashing, or changing colors,
 or a push of a button changed numbers, or when the little speaker gave some sounds, all of these times
 I was like a little kid on christmas day. Boxes of bits can do amazing things!

Conclusion: there are no small gremlins living in my computer, there is a reason for it all, there is no magic.

I now have so much appreciation for my laptop when I browse through folders or use a text editor.
I would never have enough patience to do embedded programming, and thanks to people who do.
