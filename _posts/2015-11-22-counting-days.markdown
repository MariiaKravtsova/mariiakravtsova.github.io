Aloha, thanks for visiting.

So far my journey has been incredible. The classes are difficult, lectures are inspiring, professors are nice. I have had a pleasure to meet
some amazing people already. There are people who are incredibly smart and I would like to talk for hours, and there are people who I would
rather ignore. There are about 25 days left before the finals, and I am trying to stay focused and positive to prepare myself for them. You might be
wondering what classes I am taking? Here is the list:

* CS 1310  - Foundations of Computer Science
* CS 2230  - Computer Organization and Assembly Language
* CS 3500  - Introduction to Web Technologies
* ECE 2500 - Digital Logic
* CIS 237  - Advanced C# Programming

I think that I will save it for my future posts to tell you more about each of my classes. For now lets just say that the whole graduation
countdown might have to be pushed back. Learning so much stuff is not easy. It is rather confusing actually. In the future posts I am also
planning on sharing some techniques that I have been working on to stay calm and positive.
